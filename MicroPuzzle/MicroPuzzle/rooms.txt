Inside the mouse hole - It is very dark in here
At a mousehole in the corner of the room
On the edge of a high table
At the back of a hallway
In a storage room
In the kitchen
Further down a dark smelly tunnel
By a railway siding
At the base of a tall plastic tree on the edge of a high table
Outside the open door of an oddly proportioned house
In a yellow front room
By a TV set and a recorder
At the end of a dark tunnel
By a large switch connected by the railway tracks
Alongside the winding track
A the end of the line - The track disappears through a hole in the wall
Below a whole wall of oversized video screens
Standing on the maximiser pad
On a shelf of disturbing apparatus - There is a stool nearby
On a short step stool
On the floor of an overturned box of broken electronic parts
At a hole in the wall from which a railway line emerges
At the base of a swivel chair
Standing on a computer terminal with a security lock
